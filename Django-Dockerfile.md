# Dockerfile for Django Application

This Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image for a Django application.

## Explanation

- **FROM python:3.9**: Use the official Python runtime as the base image.

- **ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1** and **ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1**: Set environment variables to ensure Python runs in unbuffered mode and does not write bytecode, which helps with Docker's caching mechanism and avoids potential issues with generating Python bytecode files.

- **WORKDIR /app**: Set the working directory inside the container to `/app`.

- **COPY . /app**: Copy the current directory contents into the container at `/app`.

- **RUN pip install --upgrade pip** and **RUN pip install -r requirements.txt**: Upgrade pip and install project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

- **EXPOSE 8000**: Expose port 8000 to allow communication to and from the Django server.

- **CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]**: Command to run the Django development server, binding it to all available IPs on port 8000.

Make sure to place this Dockerfile in the root directory of your Django project and adjust it as needed based on your project structure and dependencies. Additionally, you'll need to have a `requirements.txt` file containing the Python dependencies required for your Django application.
